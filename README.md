# Lottery

Lottery is an exercise in which I focused on the Scanner class.

I aimed to create an array that consisted of a user's input.

I proceeded to use the Random class and create an array of random numbers.

I compared the two arrays (which is sorted earlier on) and if they were identical, the user won the lottery!


Planning updates/improvements:

1. Compare the two arrays without sorting first
2. Create more if/else statements for cases where the user had some of the numbers identical
      I will create a variable for the amount of money won and the number of identical numbers will be dependent on the amount of money won!
3. Create more proof checks on whether the user inputed the correct type of input
